This project was made during my last year at my technical high school.
It was part of a scientific fair.
I worked with 2 classmates. One did the UI/UX design, the other did the backend and I did the frontend.
We used React Native, I previously worked with React but I had to learn a lot of development for mobile devices.

Unfortunately, my projects from previous years got lost on some cloud.

For some reason, GitHub won't allow me to upload several folders part of the framwework.
